GCD
===

Greatest Common Divisor

I created this project just to try out Euclid's Algorithm for finding a GCD.
I created 3 different major parts; GCD.cpp, GCDApp.cpp, and GCDTest.cpp. GCD.cpp actually finds the GCD. GCDTest.cpp performs tests to make sure GCD.cpp works. GCDApp.cpp uses GCD.cpp to create a command line app.
